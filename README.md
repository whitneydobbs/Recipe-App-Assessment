### Adding a recipe
After you fill out all of the inputs of your recipe and select "Create", the recipe will then be added to the list on the same page. Every other recipe has either a yellow or white background. If you do not fill out all inputs or the URL isn't actually a URL, you will receive an error to fix the issue.

### Deleting a recipe
Deleting simply removes the recipe from the page.
